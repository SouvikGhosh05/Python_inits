Python is the most powerful programming language in the world. Contributing something on this programming is the the most great way to do
for working on my projects. My projects will be based on how well I can work on some specific topic like Python packages, data visualisation,
data manipulation, network management,hacking, web scraping, web development like flask or django, mobile application with kivy etc.
